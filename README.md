## What I found interesting

This article talks about how the car brand Volkswagen is utilizing Microsoft's cloud technology with hopes to improve autonomous driving by managing the immense of data in a more efficient manner and putting all the AI, machine learning, and data processing onto a single platform. I thought this article was notable because the presence and role of autonomous driving in the tech and engineering industry is growing at a quick pace and it is interesting to see two large companies, Volkswagen and Microsoft, partner together to produce software for vehicles. As software grows to intersect with more and more fields, it is interesting to see how a car company is evolving into a "software-driven mobility provider"; this emphasizes the growing field and need for software engineers and how software helps transform various other fields in society. I am excited to see the potential and result of autonomous vehicle technology and the potential of the software that software engineers can create. 

## Comment from Tanya Wang (yw3087):

This article is very interesting for its focus on application of Microsoft Azure to the autonomous driving tech. Indeed, we are currently in an epic of big data, which provides great potential and convenience in availability of historical records. So, it’s a great idea of incorporating cloud computing in automotive software development. Specifically, the delivery of safe and comfortable autonomous mobility services can be accelerated through the development of connected driving solutions with Microsoft’s cloud and software engineering know-how.
